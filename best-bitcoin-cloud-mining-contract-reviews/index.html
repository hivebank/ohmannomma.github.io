Bitcoin cloud mining enables people to earn Bitcoins without bitcoin mining hardware, bitcoin mining software, electricity, bandwidth or other offline issues.
<p>Bitcoin cloud mining, sometimes called cloud hashing, enables users to buy the output of Bitcoin mining power from Bitcoin mining hardware placed in remote data centres. Then all Bitcoin mining is done remotely in the cloud. This enables the owners to not deal with any of the hassles usually encountered when mining bitcoins such as electricity, hosting issues, heat, installation or upkeep trouble.

<p>Bitcoin cloud mining contracts are usually sold for bitcoins on a per hash basis for a particular period of time.
<p>For example, Pay per GHash/s would be 0.0012 BTC / GHs for a 24 month contract.
<p>Contracts vary from hourly to multiple years. The major factor that is unknown to both parties is the Bitcoin network difficulty and it drastically determines the profitability of the bitcoin cloud hashing contracts.
<p>Bitcoin network difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.
<p>The Bitcoin network has a global block difficulty. Valid blocks must have a hash below this target. Bitcoin mining pools also have a pool-specific share difficulty setting a lower limit for shares.
<p>The Bitcoin network difficulty changes roughly every two weeks or 2,016 blocks.
