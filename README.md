# Contribute Articles to Bitcoin Mining

WUC is one of the highest profile and visited websites in Bitcoin. Our video What Is Bitcoin Mining? has had over 1.2 million views. We want BM to be a classy resource to introduce people to the concept of crypto-currency. You can responsibly leverage BM to build your Bitcoin business! For example, you could use WUC for your blog which would have several advantages such as higher search engine visibility and extremely optimized hosting.<p>
<p>
WUC uses Github to manage version control with a fork and pull method. Watch this [video by Clay Shirky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEN4XNth61o) to understand why. <b>This means your articles and contributions should be submitted as a pull request.</b> Consequently,  If you are unfamiliar then you may need to learn how to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and how to [use pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) plus this [short video may be helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTbRzhQju4c).<p>
<p>
Articles <b>should</b> be <b>(1)</b> well written, <b>(2)</b> accurate, <b>(3)</b> grammatically correct and <b>(4)</b> objective. Get audience exposure and build your reputation by receiving credit and a link in the byline for the article. Developing a good reputation will help your articles get merged in a more timely manner.

To increase the probability of success please follow these guidelines:

### Writing Articles For BM<p>
1. Create an objective article in the _posts folder<p>
2. Use the Year-Month-Date in the file name. Ex. 2015-1-23-bitcoin.md<p>
3. Length should be 500-1,200 words. However, the main criteria is quality and usefulness. Do not be afraid to create a 5,000 word guide if it is awesome.
4. Even better, develop a <b>content creation plan</b>. Take advantage of the ZMOT with a [hub and spoke model](http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-strategy/build-your-content-marketing-around-a-hub-and-spoke-model/).
5. Perform at least basic Search Engine Optimization (Ex. [Free Tool](http://www.weusecoins.com/en/questions/)).<p>
6. Link to and from other relevant pages on weusecoins.com like the extensive [FAQ](https://www.weusecoins.org/en/questions/)<p>
7. Optimize images (Ex. [Kraken.io](http://www.kraken.io))<p>
8. Find websites that will link to the article<p>
9. Mention the article on social media like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.<p>
10. Thanks for your help!<p>

### What Not To Do

BM is not a low class marketing directory. Do not SPAM links in articles. Add appropriate and objective links to Bitcoin community or news websites in the community section.<p>
For obvious reasons, when dealing with translations you should not change the meaning of any text or add or change links. Such changes should be discussed first.

# Other Language Versions

### For Web developers / Designers

This order should help get useful content available most efficiently.

<h2>Suggestions and recommendations</h2>

Translations should be accurate and professional. However, the maintainer for the language will have editorial discretion for what content should appear. This will enable adaptation to best fit each language's requirements, available resources, local businesses or active groups and general market conditions.<p>
Unfortunately, pages can easily get out of date if not maintained. That includes the HTML, fonts, CSS, scripts, social networks, etc. and allows us to update other languages when a translator is missing for a specific language.

The materials directory is used as a shared directory to store files that take significant disk space like videos.

Please help fix any broken links, bugs, typos, grammatical errors and such.

<h3>HTML structure</h3>

Please keep HTML structure as symetric and perfectly identical as possible between each page and each localized version. This should not prevent adding unique things for some languages. But please keep the rest as close as possible. This helps keep consistency.

## Thanks!
